# Welcome to fumblr!

## About:

#### fumblr is a joint project between Mario Gerardi, Ani Espinet, and Max McGrath to reimagine the design and user interface of tumblr in an attempt to modernize the blog-hosting website, as well as pay homage to the site's original look and feel.

## Key features:

#### Some key features of our app as of now are the ability to create seven different types of post, as well as register and log in and out of your account.

## Stretch features to include in future versions:

#### We are very close to implementing the ability to connect user and content models to attach a user to the content, allowing for creation of products.

## Additional notes

Preliminary design and storyboarding was created using https://figma.com.
Various icons used throughout the project were sourced from https://iconfinder.com.
Additionally, creation of color filters in CSS was greatly aided by Barrett Sonntag's CSS Filter Generator, which can be found here; https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp.
