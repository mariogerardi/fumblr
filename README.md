## README

# Welcome to fumblr!

## About:

##### fumblr is a joint project between Mario Gerardi, Ani Espinet, and Max McGrath to reimagine the design and user interface of blog-hosting website tumblr in an attempt to modernize the blog-hosting website, as well as pay homage to the site's original look and feel.

## Key features:

##### Some key features of our app as of now are the ability to create seven different types of post: text, image, quote, link, chat, audio, and video. Additionally, users can register and log in and out of their accounts.

##### We have three models, each of which we are in the process of working to talk with each other. The relationship between Content and Users will more than likely change in the future as we implement reblogging. The same goes with the relationship between Users to Blogs; they currently share a 1:1 relationship, as one User can only have one Blog. However, like tumblr, we aim to give users the ability to own multiple blogs.

#### We are VERY close to implementing the ability to connect user and content models to attach a user to the content, allowing for creation of products. Would take about an additional hour at most.

## Stretch features to include in future versions:

###### One of the key features we are working on implementing as soon as possible is the ability to reblog posts, as this is a crucial feature of tumblr's design, as well as a core feature of blogging in general.

#### Additional features to include, as per our group's goals:

##### Reblogging
##### Likes/Notes
##### User blog pages
##### Ability to follow other users
##### Nav Bar Button Functionality (account page, message page, etc.)
##### Ability to personalize theme/look of the page
##### Ability to own multiple blogs per user

## Additional notes

##### Preliminary design and storyboarding was created using https://figma.com.

##### Various icons used throughout the project were sourced from https://iconfinder.com.

##### Additionally, creation of color filters in CSS was greatly aided by Barrett Sonntag's CSS Filter Generator, which can be found here; https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp.
